-->What is Javascript?
*A technology that we use to create Websites.
*Giving Instructions to computer

                        Basic Syntax: 
Variables (let, const, var), data types (strings, numbers, arrays, 
objects), and operators.

                        -->Variables :-
*Variablesare like containers that store data values. In javascript ,we use keywords like 
let,const and var to declare Variables.

1) let :
*Use 'let' when you need  a Variable that can be reassigned later .
*'let' is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block
(like {...} where it id defined)

2)const :
*Use 'const' for variables that should not be reassigned after the initial assignment(they are constant).
*'const' is also block-scoped.
Note:- While the variable cannot be reassigned,if it is an object or an array,you can still modify the constants of the object or array.

3)var :
*'var' is function-scoped,meaning it is accessible throughout the function it is declares in,not limited by block{}.
*'var' has been mostly replaced by 'let' and 'const' in modern javaScript because its scoping can cause inexepected behaviors.

                       -->Data types
1)String:-
*Used for textual data,written within quotes("",'',or "for template literals)
=>In javascript backstick(``) are used to create a template literal,which allows you to insert variables and expressions directly into the string.
=>Template literals also support multi-libe Stringss,making them more flexible than regular srings with single('...') or double quotes("...").
Ex. let grerting=`Hello, ${name}!`;
=> ${} Syntax is used within template literals to embed variables or expressions.
=>Inside ${},you can add any javascript expression,not just simple variables.This means you can perform calculations or call functions directly within a string.
ex.
let a=5;
let b=10;
let message=`The sum of a and b is ${a+b}`;
console.log(message)
=>Templates literals with ${} make code more readable and reduce the need for complex concatenation(e.g., name+"is"+age+"year old").
it's cleaner and easier to maintain, especially for longer or dynamic strings.

2)Numbers:
*Used for numeric values,includig integers and floating point(decimal) numbers.

3)Boolean:
*Represents logical values :true or false.

4)Arrays:
*Used to store multiple values in single variable.
*Each element in an array has an index starting from 0.

5)Objects:
*Collections of key-value pairs,useful for representing structured data.

6)Undefined:
*A variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.

7)Null:
*Represents the intentional absence of a value.
